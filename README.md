# Shopping Mall Management System

## Introduction
It is a simple shopping mall management system. The mall will provide a soothing shopping experience for customers, provide mall management functions to mall administrators and inventory/staff management to shop owners at the mall.

Once you login to the application, you can perform CRUD operations on Shopping Mall modules. There are 7 modules in this project. They are:
- Customer
- Employee
- Mall
- Item
- Shop
- Shop Owner
- User

### Mall Administrator
The Mall Administrator is the super user and has complete control over all the activities that can be performed. The administrator can check the details of all the shops in the mall. The administrator can also get details about the mall employees and customers.

### Shop Owner
The Shop Owner is responsible for setting up the shop and maintaining it. The job involves managing the inventory in the shop. Also, the shop owner can add or remove customers and employees from his shop. The Shop Owner can also decide to close shop and remove it from the mall.

### Mall Customer
A Customer can browse through the shops and choose products to place in a virtual shopping cart. The shopping cart details can be viewed and customers can be removed from the cart. Also, the customer can modify personal profile information (such as phone number and shipping address) through Update.
